# The Cattiea Club Minecraft Server

This is a vanilla-eque Minecraft 1.20.4 Server that has mods as optional tools to help further community engagement and better quality of life changes while playing.

## What is this Repository?
You may have noticed that this Repo does not have any server files... You'd be correct this repo does not contain any of the server files apart from the Server's Resource Pack. This Repo allows us to update the TexturePack on the fly without having to update the ftp server with a new file.

If you wish to see the repository with all of the server files and client side MultiMC instances, check out: [CattieaMinecraftServer](https://github.com/ChromesDuzez/CattieaMinecraftServer) Repo.
